# VIC-Res: Modeling and Optimizing Water Reservoir Operations in the Variable Infiltration Capacity Model

The Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model is a popular large-scale hydrological model developed and maintained by the Computational Hydrology Research Group at the University of Washington. VIC has been used extensively to study and model river basins around the world. The model simulates key hydrological processes occurring in a river basin (e.g., water and energy balances, streamflow routing), but does not account for the operations of artificial water reservoirs. Since the environmental impact of reservoirs comes under ever-increasing scrutiny, we developed a variant of VIC that allows to: 

* Account for the presence of artificial water reservoirs;
* Optimize their operations; 
* Explore the sensitivity of the model output w.r.t. the parameters of the operating rules;
* Automatically calibrate the model parameters.

### Prerequisites

VIC-Res is based on VIC 4.2 -â€” the last release of the VIC Version 4 development track, which has a large number of active users. The key difference between VIC 4.2 and VIC-Res stands in the routing module (written in FORTRAN), which has been modified to account for the presence and operations of water reservoirs. The two models share the same rainfall-runoff module (written in C). Both VIC and VIC-Res have been developed for Linux and Unix platforms, and they require the GNU and G77 compilers. 

The optimization of the rule curves/operating rules, model sensitivity analysis, and automatic calibration of the model parameters can be executed on both Python 2.7x and 3.x. The three functionalities require the following Python packages: (i) Numpy, (ii) os, (iii) multiprocessing, (iv) scipy, (v) numba, (vi) Matplotlib (optional for plotting), and (vii) plotly (optional for parallel coordinate plots). 

The optimization-related components also require [Platypus](https://github.com/Project-Platypus/Platypus) - a platform for Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) in Python.

The sensitivity analysis requires the Sensitivity Analysis for Everybody ([SAFE](https://www.safetoolbox.info/info-and-documentation/)) toolbox (Python version), developed by Pianosi et al. (2015).

VIC-Res has been tested on Linux Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr) and 16.04 (Xenial Xerus) operating systems.

### How to run

**A. How to run the reservoir component of VIC-Res**

This task can be carried out through the following steps:

1 Download/compile the source code (by using GNU and G77/GFORTRAN)

2 Prepare the input files:

* Climate forcings (e.g. precipitation, maximum/minimum temperature, wind, etc.)
* Land use
* Soil parameters
* Flow direction
* Location of basin outlet
* Location of reservoirs (new)
* Reservoir parameters (new)

3 Configure the output files

More information on how to run the original version of VIC can be found here:
```
https://vic.readthedocs.io/en/master/
```
The sequence of syntax to run VIC-Res is similar to the one adopted by VIC.

**B. How to run optimization for rule curves/operating rules**

The Python code and configuration file for this function are *optimization.py* and *reservoiroptimization.txt*. There are four required tiers of information:

* Simulation parameters: length of simulation and spinning periods, number of function evaluations, population size, and number of computer cores.
* Objective functions: there are six options, which can be activated using the numbers 0 (not to consider) or 1 (consider).
	* Option 1: Minimize the average annual deficit of downstream water supply (m3) 
	* Option 2: Maximize the average annual hydropower production (MWh)
	* Option 3: Maximize the firm hydropower production (MWh)
	* Option 4: Minimize the peak flow (m3/s)
	* Option 5: Minimize the the number of days above a pre-defined flood threshold (days)
	* Option 6: Minimize the average annual deviation from a pre-defined water (m)
* List of reservoirs considered in the optimization problem.
* Additional data: path to water demand file (for Option 1), observed peak flow (m3/s; for Option 4), flooding threshold (m3/s; for Option 5), and path for the pre-defined reservoir water levels (365 values in m; for Option 6).

This function creates *optimization_objectives.txt* and *optimization_variables.txt* files as a result.

**C. How to run eFAST and EET analyses**

Users can call *eFAST_analysis.py* or *EET_analysis.py*. These two functions fist create two sampling sets, which are saved  in the files called *eFASTparameters.txt* and *EETparameters.txt*. VIC-Res is then fed by the sampling sets. eFAST or EET provide either sensitivity indices (eFAST; in files *SiNSE.txt* and/or *SiTRMSE.txt*) or mean indices (EET; in files *miNSE.txt* and/or *miTRMSE.txt*).

#### Required Input Files:

In the configuration file (`EET_setup.txt` or `eFAST_setup.txt`), users need to provide the following information:

* Simulation parameters: length of the simulation and spinning periods, and number of computer cores.
* VIC model parameters: 0 (not to consider) and 1 (consider)
	* Option 1: Variable infiltration curve parameter, b
	* Option 2: Fraction of Dmax where non-linear baseflow begins, Ds
	* Option 3: Maximum velocity of baseflow, Dmax (mm/day)
	* Option 4: Fraction of maximum soil moisture where non-linear baseflow occurs, Ws
	* Option 5: Exponent of the nonlinear part of the baseflow curve, c
	* Option 6: Thickness of top soil moisture layer, Depth 1 (m)
	* Option 7: Thickness of 2nd soil layer, Depth 2 (m)
	* Option 8: Thickness of 3rd soil layer, Depth 3 (m)
	* Option 9: Wave velocity in the channel routing (m/s)
	* Option 10: Diff diffusivity in the channel routing (m2/s)
* The list of reservoirs considered in the sensitivity analysis.
* Fitness functions: there are two options (NSE and TRMSE).

**D. How to run automatic calibration**

The automatic calibration is implemented using **multi-objective evolutionary algorithms** for two calibration strategies:

- **Basin-wide calibration**: `basin_calibration_eNSGAII.py`
- **Zone-specific calibration**: `zone_calibration_eNSGAII.py`
   
#### Required Input Files:  

- **Zone-wise classification of model grid cells:** `zone.txt`  
- **Configuration settings:** `calibration_setup.txt`

The configuration file (`calibration_setup.txt`) is organized similarly to the sensitivity analysis configuration file. However, the parameters of the reservoir operating rules are not taken into account in this case.

As for the objective functions, users can choose among the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), which measures the model accuracy primarily during high-flow periods; Box-Cox Transformed Root Mean Squared Error (TRMSE), which accounts for low-flow periods; Runoff COefficient Error (ROCE), which accounts for the long-term water balance; and Mean Squared Derivative Error (MSDE), an indicator of the fit of the hydrograph shape.

### How to customize

**A.How to run VIC-Res considering multiple reservoirs and multiple stations**

VICRes is designed to model multiple reservoirs within the considered basin and to estimate the discharges for multiple stations throughout the basin. However, the code in this repository allows for the modelization of a maximum of 200 reservoirs and 20 stations. If you want to consider more reservoirs and/or stations, you need to open the file rout.f in the source code and modify the values of the two parameters NRESER_MAX (number of reservoirs) and NSTATIONS_MAX (number of stations) accordingly.

Additionally, here follow a couple of suggestions on how to set up the 'stations.txt' file required for modeling multiple stations. Each station in the 'stations.txt' file (located in the 'routing/parameters' folder) needs to be defined with a unique number, followed by the term 'STATION' (e.g., '1STATION', '2STATION', ..., 'NSTATION'). This is because when the model reads the 'stations.txt' file, it saves the station names in a string of 5 characters. Therefore, if the unique number comes first, the model can differentiate between the different station names.

Finally, the station corresponding to the outlet section of the river basin must be the last station in the station list in the 'stations.txt' file. The model reads the file station by station and remembers the order in which it reads them. In the end, it outputs files for each station. For the outlet station of the basin, it will automatically include all the reservoirs present in the basin.

**B. How to customize the reservoir component of VIC-Res**

Representation of water reservoirs:
The reservoir location is stored in the file *reservoirlocation.txt*, which has the same number of rows and columns of the flow direction matrix. This file contains integer numbers:

* '1' - '9998' represent the ID of reservoirs/dams
* '9999' represents open water surface (reservoir cells)
* '0' refers to other land use

Note: avoid using No. (n+1) for reservoir name (n is the number of reservoirs) because this is used for the basin outlet.

Operation of water reservoirs:
For each reservoir (e.g., ID = 1), there is a reservoir configuration file (e.g., *res1.txt*), containing specifications on the maximum water level (*m*), minimum water level (*m*), storage capacity (*1000 m3*), hydraulic head (*m*; optional for the calculation of hydropower production), design discharge (*m3/s*), year of commission, initial water volume (*1,000 m3*), reservoir name, seepage rate (*m3/s*), infiltration rate (*m3/s*), irrigation (*m3/s*), option to turn on/off the hydropower generator, percentage of environmental flow from the maximum reservoir flow, operation strategy, and bathymetry parameters. The bathymetry parameters in the reservoir parameter file improve the representation of reservoir bathymetry using detailed hypsometric curves that relate area, storage, and elevation.

There are six operating strategies adopted in this software package

* Option 1: Simplified rule curve. There are four parameters required, including predefined maximum and minimum water levels (H1 and H2) at the time T1 and T2 at which these levels are reached.
* Option 2: Rule curve. There are monthly target water levels.
* Option 3: Operating rule. The rule curve is defined via four parameters (x1, x2, x3 and x4).
* Option 4: Predefined release time series data. Users must provide a link to a time series, containing daily release data over the simulation horizon. Although the time series data are provided, the real amount of water released is dependent on physical contraints of the reservoirs (e.g. maximum design discharge) as well as the available water.
* Option 5: Operating rule. Similar to Option 3, but the operating rules can be different in every month (twelve operating rules for a year)
* Option 6: Predefined reservoir volume time series data. Similar to Option 4, users must provide a link to a time series, containing daily volume data over the simulation period. Although the time series data are provided, the real volume is dependent on the available water. 

**C. How to customize other components (optimization, sensitivity analysis, and automatic calibration)**

Each of these functions has a configuration file as mentioned above. Users only need to modify this configuration file, so they do not need to change the current file/folder arrangement. The current version of VIC-Res is available with the eps-NSGA-II algorithm, so in case another MOEA algorithm is chosen, please change the algorithm's parameters accordingly.

**D. How to implement parallel modelling**

Users can parallelize modelling steps in optimization, sensitivity analyses, and automatic calibration via the two following steps:

* Modify *the number of cores* parameter in configuration files.
* Modify the link to the folder where modelling results are stored in Python codes, so there is no conflict in data storage.

**E. How to run Step-By-Step simulations**

Users can run the model in step-by-step mode, which enables coupling VIC-Res with external models (e.g., sediment transport or power system models). The model can run one step at a time, exchange outputs (e.g., hydropower or streamflow) with external models, and then progress to the next time step while maintaining state information. 

The Step-By-Step mode can be specifcied in the "configuration" file by setting the "Simulation Mode" option to "true". The "Start Day and Current Simulation Day" option is added to progress the simulation day in the Step-By-Step version.  


### Examples

VIC-Res is demonstrated via one case study

- A â€˜toyâ€™ case study, that is considering two dams in Cambodia (Atay and Lower Chrum), represented in a small catchment with dimension of 5 x 5 (cell) (see *routing/parameters* folder). The representation of water reservoirs is exemplified in the file *reservoirlocation.txt*, which contains two reservoirs. The files containing all specifications of these reservoirs (see *routing/parameters/reservoirs/res_par* folder) are named *res1.txt* and *res2.txt*.
